# House Price Data Analysis Project

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and accurate predictive model for estimating house prices. By leveraging comprehensive data pre-processing and advanced machine learning techniques, the project aims to transform raw housing data into actionable insights that support decision-making in the real estate sector.

This project focuses on:
- **Data Exploration & Processing:**  
  Utilizing libraries such as **NumPy** and **Pandas** to clean and analyze the dataset, identify missing or inconsistent data, and prepare it for modeling.
  
- **Data Visualization:**  
  Employing **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create informative visualizations that reveal data distributions, trends, and correlations within the dataset.
  
- **Feature Engineering:**  
  Enhancing the dataset by creating and selecting relevant features that significantly impact house price predictions.
  
- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Implementing various models including **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** to predict house prices, and optimizing these models using **GridSearchCV** from **scikit-learn** for improved performance.
